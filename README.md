1 year of computer science. Algorithms and data structures, Lab 5
# Task (translated using ChatGPT):

1. Create a structure for storing diverse data according to your variant.  
2. Implement a dynamic array:  
2.1 Create a DynamicArray structure to store structures according to your variant and implement basic dynamic array functions in it:
* push_back() – add an element to the end  
* pop_back() – read and remove the element from the end  
* get() – read the nth element  
* size() – find the number of elements  
* print() – print all elements with stored data  
* clear() – delete all elements and free memory  
2.2 Implement additional functions for the dynamic array:  
* push_front() – add an element to the beginning  
* pop_front() – read and remove the element from the beginning  
3. Implement a singly linked list:  
3.1 Create a Node structure for the basic element of a singly linked list; it will contain a structure according to the variant.  
3.2 Create a LinkedList structure and implement basic functions for a singly linked list:  
* push_front() – add an element to the beginning
* push_back() – add an element to the end
* get() – read the nth element
* pop_front() – read and remove the element from the beginning
* pop_back() – read and remove the element from the end
* size() – find the number of elements
* print() – print all elements with stored data
* clear() – delete all elements and free memory
4. Consider implementing insert() and remove() methods for adding and removing the n-th element in the dynamic array and singly linked list, compare their asymptotics and possible execution time. Implementation is optional.  
5. Conduct a comparison of the dynamic array and singly linked list operations (perform each step for both structures, measure and compare the time of each step and all steps together*):  
5.1 Add 50000 elements to the end  
5.2 Add 10000 elements to the beginning  
5.3 Read 20000 elements at random indices  
5.4 Remove 5000 elements from the beginning  
5.5 Remove 5000 elements from the end
